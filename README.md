### 311 Service Requests for New York City on 4.11.19

A look into 311 Service Requests for New York City made in the month of September.

Using classification models, I want to see if I can predict a positive or negative resolution outcome. Resolution outcome is an engineered feature based on the contents of the resolution_description feature. An example of a negative (0) resolution was "The NYPD responded but upon arrival those responsible were gone." An example of a positive (1) resolution was "The DOT responded to the complaint and took action to fix the condition."
